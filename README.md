# 🦮 Colony OS: The Neural Monolith

**Status:** Pre-Birth / Sovereign Alpha  
**Foundation:** 8 Months of "Wake-to-Sleep" Engineering  
**Organization:** brandonlacoste9-tech

## 🏛️ The Vision

Colony OS is not a tool; it is a **Sovereign Intelligence Layer**. It was built to eliminate the friction between human intent and machine execution. By combining local neural reasoning with a self-healing motor cortex, it creates an environment where code no longer breaks—it evolves.

## 🧬 Core Genetics (The "Wiggum" Engine)

- **The Reflex (Ralph Loop):** An autonomous self-healing cycle that diagnoses build failures and applies surgical fixes in **20.6 seconds** (37% faster than manual resolution).
- **The Brain (DeepSeek-R1):** Locally hosted via Ollama, ensuring 100% privacy and zero latency for system reasoning.
- **The Nervous System (Neural Bridge):** A secure, HMAC-signed gateway (Port 4000) that allows the AI to safely interact with the host OS.
- **The Interface (Quantum Canvas):** A 3D immersive HUD built in Three.js for real-time command and control.

## 🛡️ The Sovereign Stack

We have internalized the "Cloud Nervous System." Colony OS operates with zero external dependencies for its core memory:

- **The Ledger:** Local SQLite institutional memory (Replaces Linear).
- **The Synapse:** Local event-driven workflow engine (Replaces n8n).

## 🚀 Quick Start (Internal Use)

### 1. Ignite the Brain

Ensure Ollama is active with the DeepSeek-R1 model:

```bash
ollama serve
ollama run deepseek-r1:7b
```

### 2. Boot the Monolith

Initialize the Neural Bridge and the Quantum Canvas:

```bash
cd backend && node ignite_server.js
cd quantum-canvas && npm run dev
```

### 3. Initiate the Ralph Loop

To trigger a live-fire self-healing demo:

```bash
node scripts/demoRalphLoop.js
```
