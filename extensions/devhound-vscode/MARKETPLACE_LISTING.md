# DevHound: Your Autonomous Code Repair Companion 🦮

> **"It's like having a senior engineer constantly reviewing your code—and fixing the boring stuff for you."**

## 🚨 The Problem

You spend hours every week fixing:

- `undefined is not a function` runtime crashes
- Typescript `any` loopholes
- Forgotten `console.log` statements
- Silly logic errors like `if (a == b)`

## 🛠️ The Solution: DevHound

DevHound runs locally on your machine, scanning your files for these insidious bugs. But it doesn't just _find_ them—it **fixes** them.

### Features

#### 1. ⚡ Instant Autonomous Repair

Identify a bug? Just click **Fix**. DevHound rewrites the code for you, handling syntax, imports, and logic.

#### 2. 🛡️ Privacy-First (Local Execution)

Your code **never** leaves your machine. DevHound's "Ralph Lite" engine runs entirely within VS Code on your desktop. No cloud APIs, no data leaks.

#### 3. 🧠 Deep Diagnostics (CLI Integration)

Unlock more power with the `@devhound/cli`. The extension integrates seamlessly with the full CLI toolkit for DeepSeek/Gemini powered AI analysis.
