# 🦮 DevHound for VS Code

**Autonomous Code Repair Companion**

DevHound acts as a proactive "watchdog" for your code. It runs locally, identifying bugs, bad patterns, and potential runtime errors that standard linters miss—and offers one-click autonomous fixes.

## ✨ Features

- **🔍 Scan & Fix**: Hit `Ctrl+Alt+D` to scan the current file.
- **🩺 Deep Diagnosis**: Identifies logical issues like `undefined` access, empty catch blocks, and loose equality.
- **⚡ Autonomous Repair**: Select an issue and watch DevHound rewrite the code instantly.
- **🔒 100% Local**: No code leaves your machine. Privacy-first design.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  Open any JavaScript or TypeScript file.
2.  Run Command: `DevHound: Scan & Fix Current File` (or click "DevHound" in the status bar).
3.  Choose a fix from the dropdown.

## ⚙️ Configuration

- `devhound.autoFixOnSave`: Enable to automatically fix safe issues on save (Default: `false`).
